# Interview with District Health Officer, Volta Region
Location: District Health Directorate, Volta Region
Language: Conducted in English (with occasional Twi phrases)
Respondent Profile: Male, early 40s, Deputy District Director of Public Health, 12 years' experience

## Role Description
- Oversees public health programs (disease surveillance, maternal/child health, school health, community outreach)
- Supervises CHOs, health centers, and works with facility in-charges to implement MOH and GHS programs

## Skin Conditions Context
- Very common, especially fungal infections, scabies outbreaks in schools, burns from domestic accidents
- Often underreported as system prioritizes malaria, TB, maternal deaths
- Impacts productivity but receives little programmatic attention

## Current Handling Protocol
- Frontline workers refer serious cases to next level (health center nurse or district hospital)
- CHWs not licensed to diagnose
- Nurses manage simple infections but should escalate complex cases
- Documentation expected but informal referrals (verbal, WhatsApp) are common
- Frontline workers lack confidence in dermatology due to limited training

## App Requirements
- Must be simple, fast, and not create extra reporting burden
- Offline mode essential
- Triage risk assessment to guide referrals and reduce unnecessary overload
- Case storage with later syncing for rural zones
- Linkage to nurse supervisors for accountability
- Dashboard access for DHMT to monitor cases and plan interventions

## Priority Conditions
- Tinea capitis (ringworm of the scalp)
- Scabies
- Impetigo
- Buruli ulcer (endemic in some areas)
- Diabetic ulcers (for referral)
- Burns (small domestic injuries)

## Scaling Considerations
- Must embed into training packages
- Align with GHS systems
- Improve referrals
- Reduce unnecessary patient transport
- Increase early detection

## Concerns
- Data ownership: Ministry and GHS must retain control
- Sustainability: Maintenance after project ends
- Duplication: Must not replace clinical judgment or overload staff
